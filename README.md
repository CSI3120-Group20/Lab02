# Lab 2

## Running this lab on your computer
Under the directory ```/Lab02/lab2```, execute one of the following commands from the terminal (it depends on how you installed OCaml):
```
opam exec -- dune exec lab2
```
or
```
dune exec lab2
```

These commands will build the project and then launch the executable it creates.
